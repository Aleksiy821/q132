## About me: 
I am 18 years old.

At the moment I am a third-year student majoring in INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SOFTWARE, System Programming.

After graduating from college, as our teachers told us, we will be back-end developers.

Already in the middle of the second course, I thought and decided that I want to develop in front-end development.

I started my studies with web design and now I want to become a full-fledged ront-end developer.

I know languages such as Java script, CSS and HTML markup language.
